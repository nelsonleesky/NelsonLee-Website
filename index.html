        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently a fist year major Psychology major at University of California, Riverside hoping to become admitted into graduate school with hopes of acquiring a PhD<br><br>

        What is your career goal? Why did you choose it specifically and what steps have you taken toward this goal? 
        I love people. I love meeting, talking, listening, experiencing things with, and helping other people. I believe that ultimately my love for people is probably why I am so dead set on doing something in the field of psychology: to understand why people think, feel, and act the way they do. One of my strengths coincidentally is also my patience, especially when it comes to listening to others talk and to help them out with whatever they need. With these two things combined I came to realize that becoming a clinical psychologist is a career path that was perfect for me. I would be able to utilize the strength of my patience as well as my interest in psychology to help others. <br><br>

        To gain more experience for my career, I have started by acquiring a job as a Camp Counselor for KECamps for the summer of 2022 where I would mainly work with younger kids. I learned that a career in psychology would require me to interact with people of all sorts of ages, so I attained the job with the goal of getting some starting professional experience working with people of a younger demographic. Additionally, I have applied to a couple of Psychology research labs here at UC Riverside and am in the process of possibly attending interviews. I also learned that research experience is a crucial part of becoming a Clinical Psychologist, hence why I am determined to gain experience there.
	I have worked as a restaurant server for a bar where customer interaction was essential and very frequent. I believe that my experience with this occupation gave me the important skill of being able to communicate with others efficiently and cheerfully yet in a professional manner. I believe this experience has also taught me how to cooperate with others in a fast-paced and chaotic environment, and to be able to maintain a calm composure even in high-stress situations.
